# Infish

## Development

- Use uuids instead of integers as ids
- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` env vars are required to start the app
- If you want to add an image that you want to include without asset helper (e.g. like milk.jpg), then remember to add it to `config/non_stupid_digest_assets.rb`
